This repository containts scripts for collecting the data we used to build our HoT. 

we gather pages from the following philosophy subcategories:
<ol>
  <li>Category:Philosophers_by_field</li>
  <li>Category:Philosophical_schools_and_traditions</li>
  <li>Category:Philosophical_concepts</li>
  <li>Category:Branches_of_philosophy</li>
</ol>

We additionally collect the pages belonging to subcategories of the above listed categories, but do not continue this recursion past one step. The result is a dataset containing 2933 pages.
